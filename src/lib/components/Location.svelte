                <a href="https://www.orpheus.nl">Orpheus</a> is the largest cultural stage in Apeldoorn and the wider region. They present a broad, attractive and 
                partly innovative and exclusive range of theatre and music for a wide and diverse audience from Apeldoorn 
                and the surrounding area. The theatre offers a welcoming stage to creative initiatives from inside and 
                outside the city. They are therefore an important cultural meeting place, where audiences are hospitably welcomed
                 and allowed to be inspired, challenged and entertained by us. They also welcome business events with 
                 excellent service, contributing not only to their own healthy operation, but also to Apeldoorn's
                  economic activity and positioning.
